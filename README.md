# Employee-Attendance-Data-Analysis-in-Power-BI

Project Goal:

The goal of this project is to gain insights into employee attendance patterns to improve workforce management strategies. This could involve analyzing trends in absenteeism, tardiness, or leave usage.

Data Source:

This project uses an Excel V file (data.xls or similar name) containing employee attendance data.

Reports and Dashboards:

This project includes Power BI reports and dashboards that visualize employee attendance patterns.
Briefly describe the key insights provided by the reports and dashboards (e.g., identify departments with higher absenteeism, analyze trends over time, compare leave usage across teams).

Project Files:

The repository includes the following files:
.pbix: The Power BI Desktop project file.
data.xls (or similar name): The Excel V file containing the employee attendance data.
Documentation (folder, optional): This folder can hold additional documentation, such as data dictionaries or analysis notes.

Requirements:

To open and interact with this project, you will need Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed. You can download it for free from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494.

Important Note:

Excel V files are an older format (pre-Excel 97). Power BI might not be able to directly connect to it. You may need to:
Convert the Excel V file to a newer format: You can open the file in a newer version of Excel and save it as an XLSX file (Excel Open XML Workbook).
Import the data in Power BI: Use the "Get Data" functionality in Power BI to import the data from the Excel V file. This might require some additional configuration depending on the specific version of the Excel V file.

Usage:

Download or clone this repository.
If you converted the data to a newer format, update the filename in the data.xls reference to match your new file.
Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Configure the data source connection if using the original Excel V file (consult Power BI documentation for details).
Explore the reports and dashboards to gain insights from your employee attendance data.

Further Exploration:

This project provides a starting point for analyzing employee attendance data in Power BI.
You can extend the analysis by creating additional reports and visualizations based on your specific needs (e.g., analyze reasons for absences, identify potential areas for improvement).
